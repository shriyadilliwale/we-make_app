## The Idea Behind the App

WE-make is an Android app which reveals the carbon footprint of the meals on a restaurant menu, so that you can make the most informed choice about the food you eat.

### Why is this important? 

Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to global warming. In particular, meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions. However, even among fruits and vegetables, the environmental impact of different foods varies considerably. Therefore, being able to determine the carbon footprint of what you eat can make a difference to the planet.

## How App Works

All the user has to do is to take a picture of the restaurant menu. 

The app will determine the ingredients of each dish, then display the carbon footprints of the dishes, based on the CO2 emissions produced from farm to plate.
